NOTES
=====

- The CellMatrix used during the computations has an additional column, in which
  each node is logically equivalent to a corresponding node in the first, left-most column.

CostTraits<C>
- defines the sum-type to use for cost-type C

EdgeCosts<C,topology>
- matrix defining the edge/node costs
- topology=Torus:    costE/costSE/costS
- topology=Cylinder: costNE/costE/costSE
